WHAT ARE EMOTIONS? The mention of the word emotion usually calls to mind one of the six so-calledprimary or universal emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, or disgust. Thinking about the primary emotions makes the discussion of the problem easier, but it is important to note that there are numerous other behaviors to which the label "emotion" has been attached. They include so-called secondary or social emotions, such as embarrassment, jealousy, guilt, or pride; and what I call background emotions, such as well-being or malaise, calm or tension. The label emotion has also been attached to drives and motivations and to the states of pain and pleasure.A shared biological core underlies all these phenomena, and it can be outlined as follows: 1. Emotions are complicated collections of chemical and neural responses, forming a pattern; all emotions have some kind of regulatory role to play, leading in one way or another to the creation of circumstances advantageous to the organism exhibiting the phenomenon; emotions are about the life of an organism, its body to be precise, and their role is to assist the organism in maintaining life. 2. Notwithstanding the reality that learning and culture alter the expression of emotions and give emotions new meanings, emotions are biologically determined processes, depending on innately set brain devices, laid down by a long evolutionary history. 3. The devices which produce emotions occupy a fairly restricted ensemble of subcortical regions, beginning at the level of the brain stem and moving up to the higher brain; the devices are part of a set of structures that both regulate and represent body states, which will be discussed in chapter 5. 4. All the devices can be engaged automatically, without conscious deliberation; the considerable amount of individual variation and the fact that culture plays a role in shaping some inducers do not deny the fundamental stereotypicity, automaticity, and regulatory purpose of the emotions. 5. All emotions use the body as their theater (internal milieu, visceral, vestibular and musculoskeletal systems), but emotions also affect the mode of operation of numerous brain circuits: the variety of the emotional responses is responsible for profound changes in both the body landscape and the brain landscape. The collection of these changes constitutes the substrate for the neural patterns which eventually become feelings of emotion. A special word about background emotions is needed, at this point, because the label and the concept are not a part of traditional discussions on emotion. When we sense that a person is "tense" or "edgy," "discouraged" or "enthusiastic," "down" or "cheerful," without a single word having been spoken to translate any of those possible states, we are detecting background emotions. We detect background emotions by subtle details of body posture, speed and contour of movements, minimal changes in the amount and speed of eye movements, and in the degree of contraction of facial muscles. The inducers of background emotions are usually internal. The processes of regulating life itself can cause background emotions but so can continued processes of mental conflict, overt or covert, as they lead to sustained satisfaction or inhibition of drives and motivations. For example, background emotions can be caused by prolonged physical effort-from the "high" that follows jogging to the "low" of uninteresting, nonrhythmical physical labor-and by brooding over a decision that you find difficult to make-one of the reasons behind Prince Hamlet's dispirited existence-or by savoring the prospect of some wonderful pleasure that may await you. In short, certain conditions of internal state engendered by ongOing physiological processes or by the organism's interactions with the environment or both cause responses which constitute background emotions. Those emotions allow us to have, among others, the background feelings of tension or relaxation, of fatigue or energy, of well-being or malaise, of anticipation or dread.In background emotions, the constitutive responses are closer to the inner core of life, and their target is more internal than external. Profiles of the internal milieu and viscera play the lead part in background emotions. But although background emotions do not use the differentiated repertoire of explicit facial expressions that easily define primary and social emotions, they are also richly expressed in musculoskeletal changes, for instance, in subtle body posture and overall shaping of body movement.In my experience, background emotions are brave survivors of neurological disease. For instance, patients with ventromedial frontal damage retain them, as do patients with amygdala damage. Intriguingly, as you will discover in the next chapter, background emotions are usually compromised when the basic level of consciousness, core consciousness, is compromised as well. Although the precise composition and dynamics of the emotional responses, are shaped in each individual by a unique development and environment, the evidence suggests that most, if not all, emotional responses are the result of a long history of evolutionary fine-tuning. Emotions are part of the bioregulatory devices with which we come equipped to survive. That is why Darwin was able to catalog the emotional expressions of so many species and find conSistency in those expressions, and that is why, in different parts of the world and across different cultures, emotions are so easily recognized. Surely enough, there are variable expressions and there are variations in the precise configuration of stimuli that can induce an emotion across cultures and among individuals. But the thing to marvel at, as you fly high above the planet, is the Similarity, not the difference. It is that Similarity, incidentally, that makes cross-cultural relations possible and that allows for art and literature, music and film, to cross frontiers. This view has been given immeasurable support by the work oEPaul Ekman.The biological function of emotions is twofold. The first function is the production of a specific reaction to the inducing situation. In an animal, for instance, the reaction may be to run or to become immobile or to beat the hell out of the enemy or to engage in pleasurable behavior. In humans, the reactions are essentially the same, tempered, one hopes, by higher reason and wisdom. The second biological function of emotion is the regulation of the internal state of the organism such that it can be prepared for the specific reaction. For example, providing increased blood flow to arteries in the legs so that muscles receive extra oxygen and glucose, in the case of a flight reaction, or changing heart and breathing rhythms, in the case of freezing on the spot. In either case, and in other situations, the plan is exquisite and the execution is most reliable. In short, for certain classes of clearly dangerous or clearly valuable stimuli in the internal or external environment, evolution has assembled a matching answer in the form of emotion. This is why, in spite of the infinite variations to be found across cultures, among individuals, and over the course of a life span, we can predict with some success that certain stimuli will produce certain emotions. (This is why you can say to a colleague, "Go tell her that; she will be so happy to hear it.") In other words, the biological "purpose" of the emotions is clear, and emotions are not a dispensable luxury. Emotions are curious adaptations that are part and parcel of the machinery with which organisms regulate survival. Old as emotions are in evolution, they are a fairly high-level component of the mechanisms of life regulation. You should imagine this component as sandwiched between the basic survival kit (e.g., regulation of metabolism; simple reflexes; motivations; biology of pain and pleasure) and the devices of high reason, but still very much a part of the hierarchy of life-regulation devices. For less-complicated species than humans, and for absentminded humans as well, emotions actually produce quite reasonable behaviors from the point of view of survival. At their most basic, emotions are part of homeostatic regulation and are poised to avoid the loss of integrity that is a harbinger of death or death itself, as well as to endorse a source of energy, shelter, or sex. And as a result of powerful learning mechanisms such as conditioning, emotions of all shades eventually help connect homeostatic regulation and survival "values" to numerous events and objects in our autobiographical experience. Emotions are inseparable from the idea of reward or punishment, of pleasure or pain, of approach or withdrawal, of personal advantage and disadvantage. Inevitably, emotions are inseparable from the idea of good and evil. Table 2.1. Levels of Life Regulation HIGH REASON Complex, flexible, and customized FEELINGS plans of response are formulated in conscious images and may be executed as behavior. CONSCIOUSNESS Sensory patterns signaling pain, pleasure, and emotions become images. EMOTIONS 11 BASIC LIFE REGULATION Complex, stereotyped patterns of response, which include secondary emotions, primary emotions, and background emotions Relatively simple, stereotyped patterns of response, which include metabolic regulation, reflexes, the biological machinery behind what will become pain and pleasure, drives and motivations The basic level of life regulation -the survival kit-includes the biological states that can be consciously perceived as drives and motivations and as states of pain and pleasure. Emotions are at a higher, more complex level. The dual arrows indicate upward or downward causation. For instance, pain can induce emotions, and some emotions can include a state of pain. One might wonder about the relevance of discussing the biological role of the emotions in a text devoted to the matter of consciousness. The relevance should become clear now. Emotions automatically provide organisms with survival-oriented behaviors. In organisms equipped to sense emotions, that is, to have feelings, emotions also have an impact on the mind, as they occur, in the here and now. But in organisms equipped with consciousness, that is, capable of knowing they have feelings, another level of regulation is reached. Consciousness allows feelings to be known and thus promotes the impact of emotion internally, allows emotion to permeate the thought process through the agency of feeling. Eventually, consciousness allows any object to be known-the "object" emotion and any other object-and, in so doing, enhances the organism's ability to respond adaptively, mindful of the needs of the organism in question. Emotion is devoted to an organism's survival, and so is consciousness. INDUCING EMOTIONS Emotions occur in one of two types of circumstances. The first type of circumstance takes place when the organism processes certain objects or situations with one of its sensory devices-for instance, when the organism takes in the sight of a familiar face or place. The second type of circumstance occurs when the mind of an organism conjures up from memory certain objects and situations and represents them as images in the thought process-for instance, remembering the face of a friend and the fact she has just died. One obvious fact when we consider emotions is that certain sorts of objects or events tend to be systematically linked more to a certain kind of emotion more than to others. The classes of stimuli that cause happiness or fear or sadness tend to do so fairly conSistently in the same individual and in individuals who share the same social and cultural background. In spite of all the possible individual variations in the expression of an emotion and in spite of the fact that we can have mixed emotions, there is a rough correspondence between classes of emotion inducers and the resulting emotional state. Throughout evolution, organisms have acquired the means to respond to certain stimuli-particularly those that are potentially useful or potentially dangerous from the point o􀀟view of survival-with the collection of responses which we currently call an emotion. But a word of caution is needed here. I really mean what I say when I talk about ranges of stimuli that constitute inducers for certain classes of emotion. I am allowing for a considerable variation in the type of stimuli that can induce an emotion-both across individuals and across cultures-and I am calling attention to the fact that regardless of the degree of biological presetting of the emotional machinery, development and culture have much to say regarding the final product. In all probability, development and culture superpose the following influences on the preset devices: first, they shape what constitutes an adequate inducer of a given emotion; second, they shape some aspects of the expression of emotion; and third, they shape the cognition and behavior which follows the deployment of an emotion.I} It is also important to note that while the biological machinery for emotions is largely preset, the inducers are not part of the machinery, they are external to it. The stimuli that cause emotions are by no means confined to those that helped shape our emotional brain during evolution and which can induce emotions in our brains from early in life. As they develop and interact, organisms gain factual and emotional experience with different objects and situations in the environment and thus have an opportunity to associate many objects and situations which would have been emotionally neutral with the objects and situations that are naturally prescribed to cause emotions. A form of learning known as conditioning is one way of achieving this association. A new house of a shape similar to the house in which you lived a blissful childhood may make you feel well even if nothing especially good has yet happened to you in it. Likewise, the face of a wonderful, unknown person that so resembles that of someone associated with some horrible event may cause you discomfort or irritation. You may never come to know why. Nature did not prescribe those responses, but it surely helped you acquire them. Incidentally, superstitions are born this way. There is something Orwellian about the distribution of emotions in our world: All objects can get some emotional attachment, but some objects get far more than others. Our primary biological design skews our secondary acquisitions relative to the world around us. The consequence of extending emotional value to objects that were not biologically prescribed to be emotionally laden is that the range of stimuli that can potentially induce emotions is infinite. In one way or another, most objects and situations lead to some emotional reaction, although some far more so than others. The emotional reaction may be weak or strong-and fortunately for us it is weak more often than not-but it is there nonetheless. Emotion and the biological machinery underlying it are the obligate accompaniment of behavior, conscious or not. Some level of emoting is the obligate accompaniment of thinking about oneself or about one's surroundings. The pervasiveness of emotion in our development and subsequently in our everyday experience connects virtually every object or situation in our experience, by virtue of conditioning, to the fundamental values of homeostatic regulation: reward and punishment; pleasure or pain; approach or withdrawal; personal advantage or disadvantage; and, inevitably, good (in the sense of survival) or evil (in the sense of death). Whether we like it or not, this is the natural human condition. But when consciousness is available, feelings have their maximum impact, and individuals are also able to reflect and to plan. They have a means to control the pervasive tyranny of emotion: it is called reason. Ironically, of course, the engines of reason still require emotion, which means that the controlling power of reason is often modest. Another important consequence of the pervasiveness of emotions is that virtually every image, actually perceived or recalled, is accompanied by some reaction from the apparatus of emotion. We will consider the importance of this fact when we discuss the mechanisms for the birth of consciousness in chapter 6. Let me close this comment on inducers of emotions with a reminder of a tricky aspect of the induction process. So far, I have referred to direct inducers-thunder, snakes, happy memories. But emotions can be induced indirectly, and the inducer can produce its result in a somewhat negative fashion, by blocking the progress of an ongoing emotion. Here is an example. When, in the presence of a source of food or sex, an animal develops approach behavior and exhibits features of the emotion happiness, blocking its way and preventing it from achieving its goals will cause frustration and even anger, a very different emotion from happiness. The inducer of the anger is not the prospect of food or sex but rather the thwarting of the behavior that was leading the animal to the good prospect. Another example would be the sudden suspension of a situation of punishment-for instance, sustained pain-which would induce well-being and happiness. The purifying (cathartic) effect that all good tragedies should have, according to Aristotle, is based on the sudden suspension of a steadily induced state of fear and pity. Long after Aristotle, Alfred Hitchcock built a brilliant career on this simple biological arrangement, and Hollywood has never stopped banking on it. Whether we like it or not, we feel very comfortable after Janet Leigh stops screaming in the shower and lies quietly on the bathtub floor. As far as emotion goes, there is not much escape in the setup that nature prepared for us. We get it coming and we get it gOing. The Mechanics of Emotion From experience, you know that the responses that make up emotions are most varied. Some responses are easily apparent in yourself and in others. Think of the muscles in the face adopting the configurations that are typical of joy or sorrow or anger; or of the skin blanching as a reaction to bad news or flushing in a situation of embarrassment; or consider the body postures that signify joy, defiance, sadness, or discouragement; or the sweaty and clammy hands of apprehension; the racing heart associated with pride; or the slowing, near-stillness of the heart in terror. Other responses are hidden from sight but no less important as the myriad changes that occur in organs other than blood vessels, Skin, and heart One example is the secretion of hormones such as cortisol that change the chemical profile of the internal milieu; or the secretion of peptides, such as B-endorphin or oxytocin, that alter the operation of several brain circuits. Another is the release of neurotransmitters, such as the monoamines, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. During emotions, neurons located in the hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and brain stem release those chemical substances in several regions of the brain up above and, by so doing, temporarily transform the mode of working for many neural circuits. Typical consequences of the increase or decrease of release of such transmitters include the sense we have of the mind processes speeding up or slowing down, not to mention the sense of pleasantness or unpleasantness that pervades mental experience. Such sensing is part of our feeling of an emotion. Different emotions are produced by different brain systems. In the very same way that you can tell the difference between a facial expression of anger and a facial expression of joy, in the very same way in which you can feel the difference between sadness or happiness in your flesh, neuroscience is beginning to show us how different brain systems work to produce, say, anger or sadness or happiness. The study of patients with neurological diseases and focal brain damage has yielded some of the most revealing results in this area, but these investigations are now being complemented by functional neuroimaging of individuals without neurological disease. I should note that the work with human subjects also permits a rich dialogue with investigators who are approaching some of these same problems in animals, another welcome novelty in this area of research. The essence of the available findings can be summarized as follows. First, the brain induces emotions from a remarkably small number of brain sites. Most of them are located below the cerebral cortex and are known as subcortical. The main subcortical sites are in the brain-stem region, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain. One example is the region known as periaqueductal gray (PAG), which is a major coordinator of  emotional responses. The PAG acts via motor nuclei of the reticular formation and via the nuclei of cranial nerves, such as the nuclei of the vagus nerve. Another important subcortical site is the amygdala. The induction sites in the cerebral cortex, the cortical sites, include sectors of the anterior cingulate region and of the ventromedial prefrontal region. Second, these sites are involved in processing different emotions to varying degrees. We have recently shown, using PET imaging, that the induction and experience of sadness, anger, fear, and happiness lead to activation in several of the sites mentioned above, but that the pattern for each emotion is distinctive. For instance, sadness consistently activates the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, and brain stem, while anger or fear activate neither the prefrontal cortex nor hypothalamus. Brain-stem activation is shared by all three emotions, but intense hypothalamic and ventromedial prefrontal activation appears specific to sadness.IS Third, some of these sites are also involved in the recognition of stimuli which signify certain emotions. For instance, a series of studies in my laboratory has shown that a structure known as the amygdala, which sits in the depth of each temporal lobe, is indispensable to amygdala brain-stem nuclei ventromedial prefrontal hypothalamus and basal forebrain Figure 2.1. Principal emotion induction sites. Only one of these four sites is visible on the brain's surface (the ventromedial prefrontal region). The other regions are subcortical (see figure A.3 in the appendix for exact location). They are all located close to the brain's midline, recognizing fear in facial expressions, to being conditioned to fear, and even to expressing fear. (In a parallel body of work, the studies of Joseph LeDoux and Michael Davis have shown that the amygdala is necessary for fear conditioning and revealed details of the circuitry involved in the process.16) The amygdala, however, has little interest in recognizing or learning about disgust or happiness. Importantly, other structures, just as specifically, are interested in those other emotions and not in fear. The following description illustrates the fine etching of brain systems related to the production and recognition of emotion. It is but one among several examples that might be adduced to support the idea that there is no single brain center for processing emotions but rather discrete systems related to separate emotional patterns. Have No Fear Almost a decade ago, a young woman, to whom I shall refer as S, caught my attention because of the appearance of her brain CT scan. Unexpectedly, her scan revealed that both amygdalae, the one in the left and the one in the right temporal lobes, were almost entirely calcified. The appearance is striking. In a CT scan the normal brain shows up in myriad gray pixels, and the shade of gray defines the contours of the structures. But if a mineral like calcium has been deposited within the brain mass, the scan shows it as a bright milky white that you cannot possibly miss. All around the two amygdalae, the brain of patient S was perfectly normal. But the amount of calcium deposition was such within the amygdalae that it was immediately apparent that little or no normal function of the neurons within the amygdalae could still take place. Each amygdala is very much a crossroads structure, with pathways from numerous cortical and subcortical regions ending in it and pathways emanating from it to just as many sites. The normal operations carried out by such profuse pathway cross signaling could simply not take place on either side of the brain of S. Nor was this a recent condition in her brain. The deposition of minerals within brain tissue takes a long time to occur and the thorough and selective job we could witness in her brain had probably taken many years to accomplish, having begun within the first years of her life. For those who are curious about the causes behind the problem, I will say that S suffers from Urbach-Wiethe disease, a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by abnormal depositions of calcium in the skin and throat. When the brain is affected by calcium deposits, the most frequently targeted structures are the amygdalae. Those patients often have seizures, fortunately not severe, and a minor seizure was indeed the reason why S first came to our care. We were able to help her and she has not had any seizures since. My first impression of S was of a tall, slender, and extremely pleasant young woman. I was especially curious to find out about her learning and memory ability and about her social demeanor. The reason for this curiosity was twofold. There was considerable controversy at the Figure 2.2. Bilateral damage of the amygdala in patient S (left panel) and normal amygdala (right panel). The sections were obtained along the two perpendicular planes shown by the white lines drawn over the brain's external surface. The black areas identified by the arrows are the damaged amygdalae. Compare with the normal amygdalae of a control brain shown in the exact same sections in the two panels on the right. time regarding the contribution of the amygdalae to the learning of new facts, some investigators believing the amygdala was a vital partner to the hippocampus in the acquisition of new factual memory, other investigators believing it had little to contribute on that score. The cUriosity regarding her demeanor was based on the fact that from studies involving nonhuman primates, it was known that the amygdala plays a role in social behaviors. I? I can make a long story short by telling you that there was nothing wrong whatsoever with S's ability to learn new facts. This was evident when I met her for only the second time and she clearly recognized me, smiled, and greeted me by name. Her one-shot learning of who I was, what my face looked like, and of my name was flawless. Numerous psychological tests would bear out this first impression, and that is precisely how things remain today. Years later, we were to show that a particular aspect of her learning was defective, but this had nothing to do with learning facts: it had to do with conditioning to unpleasant stimuli.Is Her social history, on the other hand, was exceptional. To put it in the Simplest possible terms, I would say that S approached people and situations with a predominantly positive attitude. Others would actually say that her approach was excessively and inappropriately forthcoming. S was not only pleasant and cheerful, she seemed eager to interact with most anyone who would engage her in conversation, and several members of the clinical and research teams felt that the reserve and reticence one would have expected from her was simply lacking. For instance, shortly after an introduction, S would not shy away from hugging and touching. Make no mistake, her behavior caused no discomfort to anyone, but it was invariably perceived as a far cry from the standard behavior of a patient in her circumstances. We were to learn that this very same attitude pervaded all areas of her life. She made friends easily, formed romantic attachments without difficulty, and had often been taken advantage of by those she trusted. On the other hand, she was and is a conscientious mother, and she tries hard to abide by social rules and be appreciated for her efforts. Human nature is indeed hard to describe and full of contradictions in the best of circumstances and the prime of health. It is almost impossible to do justice to it when we enter the realm of disease. The first years of research on S yielded two important results. On the one hand, S did not have any problem learning facts. In fact, it was possible to say that her sensory perceptions, her movements, her language, and her basic intelligence were no different from those of an entirely healthy average individual in terms of elementary competence. On the other hand, her social behavior demonstrated a consistent skewing of her prevailing emotional tone. It was as if negative emotions such as fear and anger had been removed from her affective vocabulary, allowing the positive emotions to dominate her life, at least by greater frequency of occurrence if not by greater intensity. This was of special interest to me because I had noticed a similar pattern in patients with bilateral damage to the anterior sector of the temporal lobe, who, as a part of their large lesions, also had damage to the amygdalae. It was reasonable to hypothesize that their affective lopsidedness was traceable to damage in the amygdala. All of these suppositions were to be turned into hard fact when Ralph Adolphs joined my laboratory. Using a variety of clever techniques in the investigation of several patients, some with damage to the amygdala and some with damage to other structures, Adolphs was able to determine that the affective lopsidedness was mostly caused by the impairment of one emotion: fear.Using a multidimensional scaling technique, Adolphs showed that S cannot consistently tell the expression of fear in another person's face, especially when the expression is ambiguous or other emotions are being expressed simultaneously. She has no such problem with the recognition of other facial expressions of emotion, namely, that of surprise which is, in many respects, similar in general configuration. Curiously, S, who has a remarkable gift for drawing and has good drafting skills, cannot draw a face that represents fear although she can draw faces that represent other emotions. When asked to mimic facial expressions of emotions she does so easily for the primary emotions but not for fear. Her attempts produce little change in her facial expression after which she confesses her complete failure. Again, she has no difficulty producing a facial expression of surprise. Lastly, S does not experience fear in the same way you or I would in a situation that would normally induce it. At a purely intellectual level she knows what fear is supposed to be, what should cause it, and even what one may do in situations of fear, but little or none of that intellectual baggage, so to speak, is of any use to her in the real world. The fearlessness of her nature, which is the result of the bilateral damage to her amygdalae, has prevented her from learning, throughout her young life, the Significance of the unpleasant situations that all of us have lived through. As a result she has not learned the telltale signs that announce possible danger and possible unpleasantness, especially as they show up in the face of another person or in a situation. Nowhere has this been proved more clearly than in a recent study requiring a judgment of trustworthiness and approachability based on human faces.20 The experiment called for the judgment of one hundred human faces that had been preViously rated by normal individuals as indicating varied degrees of trustworthiness and approachability. There were fifty faces that had been consistently judged as inspiring trust and fifty that were not. The selection of these faces was made by normal individuals who were asked a simple question: How would you rate this face on a scale of one to five, relative to the trustworthiness and approachability that the owner of the face inspires? Or, in other words, how eager would you be to approach the person with this particular face if you needed help? Once the one hundred faces were properly distributed based on the ratings of the forty-six normal individuals, we turned to patients with brain damage. S was one of three patients with bilateral damage to the amygdala included in the study, but we also investigated the performance of seven patients with damage to either the left amygdala or right amygdala, three patients with damage to the hippocampus and an inability to learn new facts, and ten patients with damage elsewhere in the brain, i.e., outside the amygdala and outside the hippocampus. The results were far more remarkable than we expected.  S, along with other patients who also have damage to the amygdalae on both sides of the brain, looked at faces that you or I would consider trustworthy and classified them, quite correctly, as you or I would, as faces that one might approach in case of need. But when they looked at faces of which you or I would be suspicious, faces of persons that we would try to avoid, they judged them as equally trustworthy. The patients with damage to only one amygdala, the amnesic patients, and the other brain-damaged patients performed as normals do. The inability to make sound social judgments, based on previous experience, of situations that are or are not conducive to one's welfare has important consequences for those who are so affected. Immersed in a secure Pollyanna world, these individuals cannot protect themselves against simple and not-so-simple social risks and are thus more vulnerable and less independent than we are. Their life histories testify to this chronic impairment as much as they testify to the paramount importance of emotion in the governance not just of simple creatures but of humans as well. How It All Works In a typical emotion, then, certain regions of the brain, which are part of a largely preset neural system related to emotions, send commands to other regions of the brain and to most everywhere in the body proper. The commands are sent via two routes. One route is the bloodstream, where the commands are sent in the form of chemical molecules that act on receptors in the cells which constitute body tissues. The other route consists of neuron pathways and the commands along this route take the form of electrochemical signals which act on other neurons or on muscular fibers or on organs (such as the adrenal gland) which in turn can release chemicals of their own into the bloodstream. The result of these coordinated chemical and neural commands is a global change in the state of the organism. The organs which receive the commands change as a result of the command, and the muscles, whether the smooth muscles in a blood vessel or the striated muscles  in the face, move as they are told to do. But the brain itself is changed just as remarkably. The release of substances such as monoamines and peptides from regions of nuclei in the brain stem and basal forebrain alters the mode ofprocessing of numerous other brain circuits, triggers certain specific behaviors (for example, bonding, playing, crying), and modifies the signaling of body states to the brain. In other words, both the brain and the body proper are largely and profoundly affected by the set of commands although the origin of those commands is circumscribed to a relatively small brain area which responds to a particular content of the mental process. Now consider this: Beyond emotion, specifically described as the collection of responses I just outlined, two additional steps must take place before an emotion is known. The first is feeling, the imaging of the changes we just discussed. The second is the application of core consciousness to the entire set of phenomena. Knowing an emotion-feeling a feelingonly occurs at that point. These events can be summarized by walking through the three key steps of the process: I. Engagement of the organism by an inducer of emotion, for instance, a particular object processed visually, resulting in visual representations of the object. Imagine running into Aunt Maggie, whom you love and have not seen in a long time. Chances are you will immediately recognize Aunt Maggie, but even if you do not, or even before you do, the basic process of emotion will continue on to the next step. 2. Signals consequent to the processing of the object's image activate all the neural sites that are prepared to respond to the particular class of inducer to which the object belongs. The sites I am talking about-for instance, in the ventromedial prefrontal cortices, amygdala, and brain stem-have been preset innately, but past experience with things Maggie has modulated the manner in which they are likely to respond, for instance, the ease with which they will respond. By the way, Aunt Maggie is not traveling all over your brain in the form of a passport  photo. She exists as a visual image, arising out of neural patterns generated by the interaction of several areas in early visual cortices, largely in occipital lobes. Signals consequent to the presence of her image travel elsewhere and do their job when parts of the brain that are interested in things Maggie respond to such signals. 3. As a result of step 2, emotion induction sites trigger a number of signals toward other brain sites (for instance, monoamine nuclei, somatosensory cortices, cingulate cortices) and toward the body (for instance, viscera, endocrine glands), as previously discussed. Under some circumstances the balance of responses may favor intrabrain circuitry and engage the body minimally. This is what I have called "as if body loop" responses. The combined result of steps I, 2, and 3 is a momentary and appropriate collection of responses to the circumstances causing the whole commotion: for instance, Aunt Maggie in Sight; or the death of a friend announced; or nothing that you can tell consciously; or, if you are a baby bird in a high nest, the image of a large object flying overhead. Take the latter example. The baby bird has no idea that this is a predatory eagle, and no conscious sense of the danger of the situation. No thought process, in the proper meaning of the term, tells the baby bird to do what it does next, which is to crouch as low as possible in the nest, as quietly as possible, such that it may become invisible to the eagle. And yet, the steps of the process that I have just described were engaged: visual images were formed in the baby bird's visual brain, some sectors of the brain responded to the kind of visual image the brain formed, and all the appropriate responses, chemical and neural, autonomic and motor, were engaged at full tilt. The quiet and slow tinkering of evolution has done all the thinking for the baby bird, and its genetic system has dutifully transmitted it. With a little bit of help from mother bird and earlier circumstances, the miniconcert of fear is ready to be played whenever the situation demands it. The fear response that you can see in a dog or a cat is executed in exactly the same manner, and so is the fear response you can examine in yourself when you walk at night on a dark street. That we, and at least the dog and the cat, can also come to know about the feelings caused by those emotions, thanks to consciousness, is another story. In fact, you can find the basic configurations of emotions in simple organisms, even in unicellular organisms, and you will find yourself attributing emotions such as happiness or fear or anger to very simple creatures who, in all likelihood, have no feeling of such emotions in the sense that you or I do, creatures which are too simple to have a brain, or, having one, too rudimentary to have a mind. You make those attributions purely on the basis of the movements of the organism, the speed of each act, the number of acts per unit of time, the style of the movements, and so on. You can do the same thing with a simple chip moving about on a computer screen. Some jagged fast movements will appear "angry," harmonious but explosive jumps will look "joyous," recoiling motions will look "fearful." A video that depicts several geometric shapes moving about at different rates and holding varied relationships reliably elicits attributions of emotional state from normal adults and even children. The reason why you can anthropomorphize the chip or an animal so effectively is simple: emotion, as the word indicates, is about movement, about externalized behavior, about certain orchestrations of reactions to a given cause, within a given environment.Somewhere between the chip and your pet sits one of the living creatures that has most contributed to progress in neurobiology, a marine snail known as Aplysia californica. Eric Kandel and his colleagues have made great inroads in the study of memory using this very simple snail which may not have much of a mind but certainly has a Scientifically decipherable nervous system and many interesting behaviors. Well, Aplysia may not have feelings as you or I do, but it has something not unlike emotions. Touch the gill of an Aplysia, and you will see the gill recoil swiftly and completely, while the heart rate of Aplysia goes up and it releases ink into the surroundings to confuse the enemy, a bit like James Bond when he is hotly pursued by Dr. No. Aplysiais emoting with a miniconcert of responses that is formally no  Emotion and Feeling 􀁨 7I different, only simpler, from the one that you or I could display under comparable circumstances. To the degree that Aplysiacan represent its emotive state in the nervous system, it may have the makings of a feeling. We do not know whether Aplysia has feelings or not, but it is extremely difficult to imagine that Aplysia would know of such feelings if it does have them.22 SHARPENING THE DEFINITION OF EMOTION: AN ASIDE What qualifies for an emotion? Does pain? Does a startle reflex? Neither does, but if not, why not? The closeness of these related phenomena calls for sharp distinctions but the differences tend to be ignored. Startle reflexes are part of the repertoire of regulatory responses available to complex organisms and are made up of simple behaviors (e.g., limb withdrawal). They may be included among the numerous and concerted responses that constitute an emotion-endocrine responses, multiple visceral responses, multiple musculoskeletal responses, and so on. But even the simple emotive behavior of the Aplysiais more complicated than a simple startle response. Pain does not qualify for emotion, either. Pain is the consequence of a state of local dysfunction in a living tissue, the consequence of a stimulUS-impending or actual tissue damage-which causes the sensation of pain but also causes regulatory responses such as reflexes and may also induce emotions on its own. In other words, emotions can be caused by the same stimulus that causes pain, but they are a different result from that same cause. Subsequently, we can come to know that we have pain and that we are having an emotion associated with it, provided there is consciousness. When you picked up that hot plate the other day and burned the skin of your fingers, you had pain and might even have suffered from having it. Here is what happened to you, in the simplest neurobiological terms: First, the heat activated a large number of thin and unmyelinated nerve fibers, known as C-fibers, available near the burn. (These fibers,  .  I began this book by describing an obstacle: emotions cannot be known to the subject having them before there is consciousness. Now, after presenting my views on the nature of consciousness, it is time to explain how we can know an emotion. Beginning at the beginning: We know that we have an emotion when the sense of a feeling self is created in our minds. Until there is the sense of a feeling self, in both evolutionary terms as well as in a developing individual, there exist well-orchestrated responses, which constitute an emotion, and ensuing brain representations, which constitute a feeling. But we only know that we feel an emotion when we sense that emotion is sensed as happening in our organism. The sense of "happening in the organism" comes from representing the proto-self and its changes in second-order structures. The sense of the "emotion as object" comes from representing, in structures subserving second-order representations, the activity pattern in the induction sites of emotion. Following what was outlined for other objects, I propose that: (I) the inaugural proto-self is represented at second-order level; (2) the "object" that is about to change the protoself (the neural-activity pattern in emotion-induction sites) is represented at second-order level; (3) the ensuing changes in proto-self (enacted by "body loop" or "as ifbody loop" mechanisms) are also represented at second-order level. Feeling an emotion is a simple matter. It consists of having mental images arising from the neural patterns which represent the changes in body and brain that make up an emotion. But knowing that we have that feeling, "feeling" that feeling, occurs only after we build the second-order representations necessary for core consciousness. As previously discussed, they are representations of the relationship between the organism and the object (which in this case is an emotion), and of the causal effect of that object on the organism. The process that I am outlining is precisely the same we discussed for an external object, but it is difficult to envision when the object in question is an emotion, because emotion occurs within the organism, rather than outside of it. The process can only be understood when we keep in mind some of the notions introduced in the chapters on emotion (chapter 2) and on the organism (chapter 5), namely: (I) that there are several brain sites whose activity pattern induces the cortege of actions that become an emotion, and (2) that the activity pattern can be represented within second-order brain structures. Examples of emotion induction sites include nuclei in the hypothalamus, brain stem, basal forebrain, amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Examples of second-order structures include thalamus and cingulate cortices. It may sound strange, at first, that feelings of emotion-which are steeped in the representation of body states, only come to be known after other representations of body state have been integrated to give rise to a proto-self. And it sounds strange, for certain, that the means to know a feeling is another feeling. The situation becomes understandable, however, when we realize that the proto-self, feelings of  emotion, and the feelings of knowing feelings emerged at different points in evolution and to this day emerge at different stages of individual development. Proto-self precedes basic feeling and both precede the feeling of knowing that constitutes core consciousness. THE SUBSTRATE FOR FEELINGS OF EMOTION The collection of neural patterns which constitute the substrate of a feeling arise in two classes of biological changes: changes related to body state and changes related to cognitive state. The changes related to body state can be achieved by two mechanisms.! One mechanism involves what I call the "body loop." It uses both humoral signals ( chemical messages conveyed via the bloodstream) and neural signals (electrochemical messages conveyed via nerve pathways). As a result of both types of signal, the body landscape is changed and is subsequently represented in somatosensory structures of the central nervous system, from the brain stem on up. The change in the representation of the body landscape can be partly achieved by another mechanism, which involves the "as if body loop." In this alternate mechanism, the representation of body-related changes is created directly in sensory body maps, under the control of other neural sites, for instance, in the prefrontal cortices. It is "as if" the body had really been changed, but it has not. The "as if body loop" mechanism bypasses the body proper, partially or entirely, and I have suggested that bypassing the body saves both time and energy, something that may be helpful in certain circumstances. The "as if" mechanisms are not only important for emotion and feeling, but also for a class of cognitive processes one might deSignate as "internal simulation."2 The changes related to cognitive state are generated when the process of emotion leads to the secretion of certain chemical substances in nuclei of the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, and brain stem, and to the subsequent delivery of those substances to several other brain regions. When these nuclei release neuromodulators in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia, they cause a host of  significant alterations of brain function. The most important alterations I envision include (1) the induction of particular behaviors (such as bonding and nurturing, playing and exploring); (2) a change in the ongoing processing of body states (as an example, body signals may be filtered or allowed to pass, selectively inhibited or enhanced, and their pleasant or unpleasant quality altered); and (3) a change in the mode of cognitive processing (an example of the latter, in relation to auditory or visual images, would be a change from a slow to a fast rate of image production or a change from sharply focused to vaguely focused images, a change which is an integral part of emotions as disparate as those of sadness or elation). I suspect all three kinds of change are present in humans and in numerous nonhuman species. It is possible, however, that the third kind of change-the change in the mode of cognitive processingis only made conscious in humans because it requires an especially high-level representation of neural events: the sort of metarepresentation of aspects of brain processing that only prefrontal cortices are likely to support. In short, emotional states are defined by myriad changes in the body's chemical profile; by changes in the state of viscera; and by changes in the degree of contraction of varied striated muscles of the face, throat, trunk, and limbs. But they are also defined by changes in the collection of neural structures which cause those changes to occur in the first place and which also cause other Significant changes in the state of several neural circuits within the brain itself. To the simple definition of emotion as a specifically caused transient change of the organism state corresponds a simple definition for feeling an emotion: It is the representation of that transient change in organism state in terms of neural patterns and enSUing images. When those images are accompanied, one instant later, by a sense of self in the act of knowing, and when they are enhanced, they become conscious. They are, in the true sense, feelings of feelings. There is nothing vague, elusive, or nonspecific about emotional responses, and there is nothing vague, elusive, or nonspecific about the representations which can become feelings of emotions. The substrate for emotional feelings is a very concrete set of neural patterns in maps of selected structures. From Emotion to Conscious Feeling In summary, the complete course of events, from emotion to feeling to feeling of feeling, may be partitioned along five steps, the first three of which were outlined in the chapter on emotion. I. Engagement of the organism by an inducer of emotion, for instance, a particular object processed visually, resulting in visual representations of the object. The object may be made conscious or not, and may be recognized or not, because neither consciousness of the object nor recognition of the object are necessary for the continuation of the cycle. 2. Signals consequent to the processing of the image of the object activate neural sites that are preset to respond to the particular class of inducer to which the object belongs (emotioninduction sites). 3. The emotion-induction sites trigger a number of responses toward the body and toward other brain sites, and unleash the full range of body and brain responses that constitute emotion. 4. First-order neural maps in both subcortical and cortical regions represent changes in body state, regardless of whether they were achieved via "body loop," "as if body loop," or combined mechanisms. Feelings emerge. 5. The pattern of neural activity at the emotion-induction sites is mapped in second-order neural structures. The proto-self is altered because of these events. The changes in proto-self are also mapped in second-order neural structures. An account of the foregoing events, depicting a relationship between the "emotion object" (the activity at the emotion-induction sites) and the proto-self, is thus organized in second-order structures. This perspective on emotion, feeling, and knOwing is unorthodox. First, I am suggesting that there is no central feeling state before the respective emotion occurs, that expression (emotion) precedes feeling.  Second, I am suggesting that "having a feeling" is not the same as "knowing a feeling," that reflection on feeling is yet another step up. Overall, this curious situation reminds me of E. M. Forster's words: "How can I know what I think before I say it?" The inescapable and remarkable fact about these three phenomena-emotion, feeling, consciousness-is their body relatedness. We begin with an organism made up of body proper and brain, equipped with certain forms of brain response to certain stimuli and with the ability to represent the internal states caused by reacting to stimuli and engaging repertoires of preset response. As the representations of the body grow in complexity and coordination, they come to constitute an integrated representation of the organism, a proto-self. Once that happens, it becomes possible to engender representations of the proto-self as it is affected by interactions with a given environment. It is only then that consciousness begins, and only thereafter that an organism that is responding beautifully to its environment begins to discover that it is responding beautifully to its environment. But all of these processes-emotion, feeling, and consciousness-depend for their execution on representations of the organism. Their shared essence is the body. WHAT ARE FEELINGS FOR? It might be argued that emotions without feelings would be a sufficient mechanism to regulate life and promote survival. It might be argued that signaling the results of that regulatory mechanism would hardly be necessary for survival. But that is simply not the case. Having feelings is of extraordinary value in the orchestration of survival. Emotions are useful in themselves, but the process offeeling begins to alert the organism to the problem that emotion has begun to solve. The simple process of feeling begins to give the organism incentive to heed the results of emoting (suffering begins with feelings, although it is enhanced by knowing, and the same can be said for joy). The availability of feeling is also the stepping stone for the next development-the feeling of knowing that we have feelings. In turn, knowing is the stepping stone for the process of planning specific and nonstereotyped responses which can either complement an emotion or guarantee that the immediate gains brought by emotion can be maintained over time, or both. In other words, "feeling" feelings extends the reach of emotions by facilitating the planning of novel and customized forms of adaptive response. Now consider this: Knowing a feeling requires a knower subject. In looking for a good reason for the endurance of consciousness in evolution, one might do worse than say that consciousness endured because organisms so endowed could "feel" their feelings. I am suggesting that the mechanisms which permit consciousness may have prevailed because it was useful for organisms to know of their emotions. And as consciousness prevailed as a biological trait, it became applicable not just to the emotions but to the many stimuli which brought them into action. Eventually consciousness became applicable to the entire range of possible sensory events. A NOTE ON BACKGROUND FEELINGS What little attention has been paid to the neuroscience of emotion in the twentieth century has been concentrated on the core types of emotion studied by Darwin. Fear, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise, and happiness have been found to be universal emotions in terms of their facial expression and recognizability, as shown in the work of Ekman and others. As a result, the feelings that are most often considered are those which constitute the conscious readout of those major emotions. This would be all well and good ifit would not have distracted us from the fact that we continuously have emotional feelings although those feelings are not necessarily part of the set of six "universal feelings" that hail from the six universal emotions. Most of the time we do not experience any of the six emotions, which is certainly a blessing given that four of them are unpleasant. Nor do we experience any of the so-called secondary or social emotions, a good  since they hardly fare any better in terms ofpleasantness. we do experience other kinds ofemotion, sometimes low grade, sometimes quite intense, and we do sense the general physical tone of our being. I have called the readout of this background perturbation "background feelings," a term I first used in Descartes' Error, because these feelings are not in the foreground of our mind. Sometimes we become keenly aware of them and can attend to them specifically. Sometimes we do not and attend, instead, to other mental contents. In one way or another, however, background feelings help define our mental state and color our lives. Background feelings arise from background emotions, and these emotions, although more internally than externally directed, are observable to others in myriad ways: body postures, the speed and design of our movements, and even the tone of our voices and the prosody in our speech as we communicate thoughts that may have little to do with the background emotion. For this reason, I believe it is important to broaden our notion of the source of feelings. Prominent background feelings include: fatigue; energy; excitement; wellness; sickness; tension; relaxation; surging; dragging; stability; instability; balance; imbalance; harmony; discord. The relation between background feelings and drives and motivations is intimate: drives express themselves directly in background emotions and we eventually become aware of their existence by means of background feelings. The relation between background feelings and moods is also close. Moods are made up of modulated and sustained background feelings as well as modulated and sustained feelings of primary emotions-sadness, in the case of depression. Finally, the relation between background feelings and consciousness is just as close: background feelings and core consciousness are so closely tied that they are not easily separable. It is probably correct to say that background feelings are a faithful index of momentary parameters of inner organism state. The core ingredients of that index are (I) the temporal and spatial shape of the operations of the smooth musculature in blood vessels and varied organs, and of the striated muscle of heart and chest; (2) the chemical profile of the milieu close to all those muscle fibers; and (3) the presence or absence of a chemical profile signifying either a threat to the integrity of living tissues or conditions of optimal homeostasis.3 Thus, even a phenomenon as simple as background feelings depends on many levels of representation. For instance, some background feelings that have to do with internal milieu and viscera must depend on signals occurring as early as the substantia gelatinosa and intermediate zone of each segment of the spinal cord, and the pars caudalis of the trigeminal nerve nucleus. Other background feelings have to do with the cyclical operations of striated muscle in cardiac function and with patterns of contraction and dilation in smooth muscle which require representations in specific brain-stem nuclei such as the nucleus tractus solitarus and the parabrachial nucleus. My notion of background feelings is similar to the notion of vitality affects presented by the developmental psychologist Daniel Stern, a notion he uses in his work with infants. That notion was first hinted at by the remarkable but unsung American philosopher Susanne Langer, a disciple of Alfred North Whitehead.4 THE OBLIGATE BODy-RELATEDNESS OF FEELING Regardless of the mechanism by which emotions are induced, the body is the main stage for emotions, either directly or via its representation in somatosensory structures of the brain. But you may have heard that this idea is not correct, that in essence this was the idea proposed by William James-in brief, James proposed that during an emotion the brain causes the body to change, and that the feeling of emotion is the result of perceiving the body's change-and that time has cast the idea aside. First, there is more to my proposal than what was advanced by James. Second, the attack against James, which held sway throughout most of this century and still lingers, is just  not valid, although his proposal on emotion is neither flawless nor complete. The mechanisms I have outlined to enact emotion and produce a substrate for feelings are compatible with William James's original formulation on this theme but include many features absent in James's text. None of the features I have added undermines or violates the basic idea that feelings are largely a reflection of body-state changes, which is William James's seminal contribution to this subject. The new features I proposed add a new dimension to these phenomena, however. Even in the most typical course of events, the emotional responses target both body proper and brain. The brain produces major changes in neural processing that constitute a substantial part of what is perceived as feeling. The body is no longer the exclusive theater for emotions and consequently the body is not the only source for feelings, as James would have wished. Moreover, the body source may be virtual, as it were, it may be the representation of the body "as if" rather than the body "as is." I must add that I did not develop additional features or mechanisms for emotion as a means to circumvent the attacks on William James's idea, although some of my proposals do precisely that. I developed my proposals before I understood what the attackers were attacking. One might say that there is no need to respond to the critics of William James since his seminal idea is so plausible, but that would be a mistake for several reasons. First, the account offered by William James was understandably incomplete and it must be extended in modern scientific terms. Second, part of the account that was complete was not correct in the detail. For instance, James relied exclusively on representations arising in the viscera, gave short shrift to skeletal muscles as a source for the representation of feelings, and made no mention of the internal milieu. The current evidence suggests that most feelings probably rely on all sources-skeletal and visceral changes as well as changes in internal milieu. The third reason is that the misconceptions that are part of the critique and that  are still cited stand in the way of a comprehensive understanding of emotion and feeling. Emotion and Peeling after Spinal Cord Transection The idea that inputs from the body are not relevant to feelings is often based on the false notion that patients with spinal cord transection caused by injury should not be able to emote or feel. The problem, say the critics, is that they seem to be able to emote and to feel. Yet, only a part of the body input most relevant for feelings travels in the spinal cord. First, a considerable part of the relevant information actually travels in nerves such as the vagus, which exit and enter the brain at the level of the brain stem, well above the highest level of the spinal cord possibly damaged by an accident. Likewise, only a part of the enactment of emotions depends on the spinal cord: a large proportion of the process is mediated by cranial nerves at brain-stem level (which can act on the face and on viscera) and by other brain-stem nuclei (which can act directly on the brain above their level). Second, a significant part of body input actually does not travel by nerves but by way of the bloodstream, again reaching the central nervous system at the level of brain stem, for instance at the area postrema, or higher. Third, all the surveys of patients with spinal cord damage, including those that seem biased to discover an impairment of feeling and those that were biased to discover that feelings were intact, have revealed some degree of impaired feeling, as one should have expected given that the spinal cord is apartialconduit for relevant body input.5 Moreover, one undisputed fact emerged in those studies: the higher the placement of damage in the spinal cord, the more impaired feeling is. This is important because the higher the section made in the spinal cord, the less input from the body will reach the brain. Higher sections should correlate with less feeling, lower sections with more. The finding would be difficult to explain were it not that some body input is, in fact, precluded by spinal cord damage. (Although it might  be argued, not very credibly, that higher cord lesions by causing greater defects in movement would be accompanied by greater psychological defects and thus less feeling.) Fourth, spinal cord transections are hardly ever complete, thus allowing for escape pathways into the central nervous system. Fifth, some of the critics seem to conceive of the body as that part of the organism that is below the neck, the head being just forgotten. As it turns out, the face and skull, as well as the oral cavity, tongue, pharynx, and larynx-whose combination constitutes the upper portion of the respiratory and digestive tracts as well as most of the vocal system-provide a massive input into the brain. This input penetrates the brain at brain-stem level, again at a level higher than that of any spinal cord injury. Since most of the emotions express themselves prominently in changes of the facial musculature, in changes of the musculature of the throat, and 􀄗n autonomic changes of the skin in the face and scalp, the representation of the related changes in the brain does not need the spinal cord for anything whatsoever and remains available as a base for feelings, even in patients with the most complete forms of spinal cord transection. In conclusion, in normal circumstances we use the spinal cord both to enact apart of some emotions and to bring back to the brain signals about part of the enactment of those emotions. Accordingly, even the most complete section of the spinal cord fails to disrupt the two-way flow of signals required for emotion and feeling. The fact that any defect is found at all in spinal cord injury supports the notion that body input is relevant to the experience of emotion and feeling; such a defect can hardly be used to argue the opposite. But no one should expect Christopher Reeve not to have emotions and feelings after his accident. The fact that he has both is not evidence against the paramount role of the body in emotion and feeling. Evidence from the Section of Vagus Nerve and Spinal Cord The evidence from the section of the vagus nerve or of the vagus nerve and spinal cord has also been misinterpreted ever since W. Can non turned C. S. Sherrington's experiments in dogs and his own experiments in cats into the centerpiece of his 1927 attack on James.Cannon's argument is an example of the confusions that result from not distinguishing that which is external, such as an emotion, from that which is internal, such as a feeling. Why should a dog or cat, in whom the vagus nerve and spinal cord have been severed, have a complete loss of emotional display, as Cannon predicted? It should not. Severing the vagus nerve andthe spinal cord does not impede the pathways for the responses that alter the face of the animal, such that it will display rage, fear, or peaceable cooperation with the examiner. Those responses come from the brain stem and are mediated by cranial nerves which were not compromised in Sherrington's or Cannon's experiments. Those facial expressions remained intact after combined sections of the vagus and of the spinal cord, as they should. Dogs responded angrily when shown cats and vice versa, even if they could not move their bodies, which were paralyzed below the neck. (Incidentally, if those animals had been stimulated electrically in the appropriate brain sites, they would have shown the phenomenon known as "sham rage," a display of unmotivated expressions of anger.) But what about the animal's feelings? They certainly could not be tested, but based on the ideas I have proposed, those feelings were probably altered in part-the animals would receive signals from their facial expressions and would have intact signaling from brainstem nuclei, both of which would be a base for feeling, but they would not receive visceral input which would have been based on signals from the vagus nerve and the spinal cord. At this point, Cannon threw caution to the winds and wondered if feelings could possibly be far when there was so much of an emotional display. He took the presence of emotion as a sure sign for the presence of feeling. The error rests entirely with the failure of making a principled distinction between emotion and feeling and of recognizing the sequential, unidirectional enchainment of the process-from inducer, to automated emotion, to representation of emotional changes, to feeling.  Lessons from Locked-In Syndrome One of the most intriguing, albeit indirect, lines of evidence for the importance of body input in the generation of feelings comes from locked-in syndrome. As discussed in chapter 8, locked-in occurs when a part of the brain stem such as the pons or midbrain is damaged anteriorly, in its ventral aspect, rather than posteriorly, in its dorsal aspect. The motor pathways which convey signals to the skeletal muscles are destroyed, and only one pathway for vertical movement of the eyes is spared, sometimes not completely. The lesions that cause locked-in are placed directly in front of the area whose lesions cause coma or persistent vegetative state, yet locked-in patients have an intact consciousness. They cannot move any muscle in their face, limbs, or trunk, and their communication ability is usually limited to vertical movements of the eyes, sometimes one eye only. But they remain awake, alert, and conscious of their mental activity. The voluntary blinking of these patients is their sole means of communicating with the outside world. Using a blink to signify a letter of the alphabet is the laborious technique with which locked-in patients compose words, sentences, and even books, slowly dictated-one should say blinked-to an attentive note taker. A remarkable aspect of this tragic condition and one that has been neglected to date is that although patients are plunged, fully conscious, from a state of human freedom to one of nearly complete mechanical imprisonment, they do not experience the anguish and turmoil that their horrifying situation would lead observers to expect. They have a considerable range of feelings, from sadness to, yes, joy. And yet, from accounts now published in book form, the patients may even experience a strange tranquillity that is new to their lives. They are fully aware of the tragedy of their situation, and they can report an intellectual sense of sadness or frustration with their virtual imprisonment. But they do not report the terror that one imagines would arise in their horrible circumstances. They do not seem to have anything like the acute fear experienced by so many perfectly healthy and mobile individuals inside a magnetic resonance scanner, not to mention a crowded elevator. My way of explaining this surprising finding is as follows: Blinking and vertical eye movements aside, the damage in locked-in precludes any motion, either voluntary or enacted by emotional responses, of any part of the body. Facial expression and bodily gestures in response to a deliberate intention or an emotion are precluded (there is only a partial exception-tears can be produced although the motor accompaniments of crying are missing). Under the circumstances, any mental process which would normally induce an emotion fails to do so through the "body loop" mechanism we have discussed. The brain is deprived of the body as a theater for emotional realization. Nonetheless, the brain can still activate emotion-induction sites in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, and brain stem, and generate some of the internal brain changes on which feelings depend. Moreover, since most signaling systems from body to brain are free and clear, the brain can get direct neural and chemical signaling from organism profiles that fit background emotions. Those profiles are related to basic regulatory aspects of the internal milieu and are largely uncoupled from the patient's mental state because of brain-stem damage (only the bloodstream chemical routes remain open both ways). I suspect that some of the internal-milieu states are perceived as calm and harmonious. Support for this idea comes from the fact that when these patients have a condition which ought to produce pain or discomfort, they can still register the presence of that condition. For instance, they feel stiff and cramped when they are not moved by others for a long time. Curiously, the suffering that usually follows pain seems to be blunted, perhaps because suffering is caused by emotion, and emotion can no longer be produced in the body theater: it is restricted to "as if body" mechanisms. Another line of evidence corroborating this interpretation comes from patients undergoing surgery who receive an injection of curare, a substance that blocks the activity of skeletal muscles by acting on the nicotinic receptors of acetylcholine. If curare acts before the proper induction of anesthesia suspends consciousness, the patients become aware of their paralysis. Like patients with locked-in, curarized patients are able to hear the conversations of those around. Based on reports obtained after the event, these patients are less calm than patients with locked-in and closer to what one might expect if one imagines being in the same situation. There may be a clue to explain the difference. Curare blocks the nicotinic receptors of acetylcholine, the transmitter that is necessary for nerve impulses to contract muscular fibers. Since the skeletal muscles throughout our face, limbs, and trunk are of the striated type and have such nicotinic receptors, curare blocks neurochemical impulses at the site of all those neuromuscular junctions and causes paralysis. However, the nerve impulses that lead smooth muscles to respond under the autonomic control of emotions use muscarinic receptors that are not blocked by curare. Under the circumstances, it is possible for one part of the emotional responses, that which depends on pure autonomic signals, to be ellacted in the body theater and be represented back in neural structures. As a whole, this evidence suggests that the "body loop" mechanism ofemotion and feeling is of greater importance for real experience of feelings than the "as if body loop" mechanism that I have proposed as an alternate and complement. A recent series of learning experiments also provides evidence for the role of the body in emotion. It has been demonstrated, in both rats and humans, that recall of new facts is enhanced by the presence of certain degrees of emotion during learning. James McGaugh and his colleagues have led these studies whose results are now well confirmed.8 For instance, if you are told two stories of comparable length that have a comparable number of facts, differing only because in one ofthem the facts have a high emotional content, you will remember far more detail from the emotional story than from the other. You may be pleased to know that we have this in common with rats when they are placed in an equivalent situation. They, too, have better success in a standard learning situation when a certain amount of emotion happens at the right time. Now, after the vagus nerves of the rats are severed, emotion no longer helps their performance. Why so? Well, without the vagus, the rats are also deprived of substantial visceral input to the brain. It must be the case that the particular visceral input now missing is vital for the sort of emotion that assists learning.
